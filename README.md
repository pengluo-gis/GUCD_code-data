# Overlapping Community Detection from Mobility Network

This repository provides a full workflow for detecting **overlapping communities** from urban **mobility networks**, using **New York City** as a demo. The process goes from raw data to spatial mapping and socioeconomic analysis.

## 🧭 Overview

We aim to detect and analyze community structures embedded in human mobility patterns. Unlike traditional partitioning approaches, our method supports **overlapping communities**, which better reflects the complexity of urban life.

This codebase includes four main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Prepares raw mobility network data for analysis, output the A matrix and X matrix required by GCN.

2. **Community Detection**  
   Applies overlapping community detection algorithms to identify mobility-based communities.

3. **Spatial Mapping**  
   Maps community labels to geographic units (CBG level).

4. **Socioeconomic Analysis**  
   Uses external information (e.g., POIs) to interpret the detected communities from a socioeconomic perspective.

## 🏙️ New York City as Demo

We select **New York City** as a representative case study.

- We provide a sample dataset (~3,000 rows) for demonstration purposes.
- All final results (community detection, mapping, and analysis) are based on the **full mobility dataset** of NYC.
